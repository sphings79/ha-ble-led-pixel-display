# BLE LED Pixel Display - Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration for BLE LED pixel matrix displays that speak the
iPIXEL Color protocol. These panels are sold under several brands - BGLight, and as the
B.K. Light LED Pixel Board from Action - and advertise themselves as `LED_BLE_*` with
service UUID `0000fa01-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`.

> **This is a fork.** It continues [cagcoach/ha-ipixel-color](https://github.com/cagcoach/ha-ipixel-color)
> by Christian Grund, which has seen no commits since December 2025, and includes the
> image/MDI-icon work from [tigers75/ha-ipixel-color](https://github.com/tigers75/ha-ipixel-color).
> Licensed under GPL-3.0, like the original.
>
> **The integration domain is `ble_led_pixel`,** not `ipixel_color`. Both can therefore be
> installed side by side, which makes migrating one device at a time possible.

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on the three dots in the top right corner
3. Select **Custom repositories**
4. Add the repository URL: `https://github.com/sphings79/ha-ble-led-pixel-display`
5. Select **Integration** as the category
6. Click **Add**
7. Search for "BLE LED Pixel Display" in HACS and install it
8. Restart Home Assistant
9. Add the integration via Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration

### Manual Installation

1. Copy `custom_components/ble_led_pixel` to your HA `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add integration via Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration

### Optional: Custom Fonts

Place `.ttf`/`.otf` font files in the `fonts/` folder within the integration directory for additional font options.
Bundled pixel fonts (`3x5-de.ttf`, `5x5.ttf`, `7x5.ttf`) are good defaults for small matrices; `3x5-de` is the smallest.

## Entities

Once configured, you'll get these entities:

**Display Control:**

- `select.{device}_mode` - Display mode (textimage, text, clock)
- `text.{device}_display` - Enter text with templates and `\n` for newlines
- `switch.{device}_power` - Turn display on/off
- `number.{device}_brightness` - Display brightness level (1-100)

**Text Appearance:**

- `select.{device}_font` - Choose from available fonts
- `number.{device}_font_size` - Font size (0=auto, supports decimals like 12.5)
- `number.{device}_line_spacing` - Spacing between lines (0-20px)
- `switch.{device}_antialiasing` - Smooth vs sharp text
- `light.{device}_text_color` - RGB text color
- `light.{device}_background_color` - RGB background color

**Clock Mode:**

- `select.{device}_clock_style` - Clock style (0-8)
- `switch.{device}_clock_24h_format` - 24-hour time format
- `switch.{device}_clock_show_date` - Show date below time

**Update Control:**

- `switch.{device}_auto_update` - Auto-update on changes
- `button.{device}_update_display` - Manual refresh

**Device Info:**

- `sensor.{device}_width` - Display width in pixels
- `sensor.{device}_height` - Display height in pixels
- `sensor.{device}_device_type` - Device model information

## Template Examples

```jinja2
Time: {{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}
Temp: {{ states('sensor.temperature') | round(1) }}°C
{% if is_state('sun.sun', 'above_horizon') %}Day{% else %}Night{% endif %}
```

## Quick Start

**Text Mode:**

1. Select mode: `textimage` (for RGB colors) or `text` (native)
2. Set text: `"Hello\nWorld"`
3. Choose text and background colors using light entities
4. Select font and size (or use auto-sizing)
5. Toggle auto-update ON or use manual update button

**Clock Mode:**

1. Select mode: `clock`
2. Choose clock style (0-8)
3. Set 24-hour format and date display preferences
4. Time syncs automatically

**Templates:**

- Templates update automatically with sensor changes when auto-update is ON

## Services (MDI Icons, Custom Layouts, Direct Text)

These are `ble_led_pixel.*` actions, callable from Developer Tools → Actions or from any
automation/script. Unlike the `text.{device}_display` entity above (tied to the mode/color/font
entities and auto-update), these render and send an image directly, independent of the
panel's currently selected mode.

> **Templates:** `text`/`icon` fields in these services do **not** resolve Home Assistant
> templates themselves (unlike `text.{device}_display`, which explicitly re-renders templates
> server-side). A template like `{{ states('sensor.temperature') }}°C` works fine when the
> service is called from an automation or script - Home Assistant's own automation engine
> renders templates in the `data:` block before the service is called. It will **not** render
> if typed literally into the test field under Developer Tools → Actions (same caveat as `\n`
> typed there). These services are also **one-shot**: unlike `text.{device}_display` with
> auto-update, they don't re-render on their own when the underlying sensor changes - trigger
> the automation again (e.g. on the sensor's `state_changed`) to refresh the panel.

### `ble_led_pixel.send_mdi_icon`

Renders any [Material Design Icon](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) (fetched on
demand, no need to pre-install anything) and shows it centered on the panel.

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_mdi_icon
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  icon: "mdi:weather-sunny"
  color: [255, 204, 0]
  bg_color: [0, 0, 0]
  scale: 100          # 1-100, percentage of the panel's shorter side
  save_slot: 0        # 0 = don't save, >=1 = save to that device memory slot
```

### `ble_led_pixel.send_text`

Sends text using pypixelcolor's native renderer (device-side animation/scroll), with its own
parameters each call - independent of the panel's currently selected text/effect/colors, so
it's safe to call from automations without disturbing manual use of the panel.

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_text
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  text: "{{ states('sensor.temperature') }}°C"
  color: [255, 255, 255]
  bg_color: [0, 0, 0]     # omit for a transparent background
  font: "CUSONG"          # or "SIMSUN", "VCR_OSD_MONO"
  animation: 0            # 0-7; pypixelcolor itself rejects 3/4 on non-32x32 panels
  speed: 80               # 0-100
  rainbow_mode: 0         # 0-9, 0 = disabled
```

### `ble_led_pixel.send_layout`

Composes up to 4 independent MDI icons, a static image/GIF-first-frame, and/or up to 4
independent text elements - each positioned by its own top-left (x, y) corner in pixels -
onto a single canvas sent as one image. Useful for e.g. an icon on the left with a value next
to it, several status icons in a row, or several labels stacked with their own sizes/fonts/colors.

**Single icon and single text** - use the flat fields, same as before:

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_layout
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  icon: "mdi:weather-sunny"
  icon_x: 0
  icon_y: 0
  icon_size: 16          # square icon size in pixels; omitted = panel's shorter side
  icon_color: [255, 204, 0]
  image_path: "/config/www/logo.png"  # optional: any image/GIF file readable by HA
  image_x: 40                          # (only its first frame is used, if animated)
  image_y: 0
  image_width: 16                     # optional: resize
  image_height: 16
  text: "21°C"
  text_x: 18
  text_y: 4
  text_size: 8           # font size in pixels, can be fractional (e.g. 7.5)
  text_font: "7x5"        # "3x5-de" (smallest), "5x5", "7x5", "Lepidos" (3x7), "OpenSans-Light", "WP7xn"
  text_color: [255, 255, 255]
  text_wrap: true         # auto word-wrap at the panel's right edge
  text_line_spacing: 1    # extra pixels between wrapped/forced lines
  text_scroll: false      # see below
  bg_color: [0, 0, 0]
  save_slot: 0
```

`icon`, `image_path` and `text` are all optional independently - use any combination, or just
one of them.

**Multiple texts** (up to 4) - use `texts` instead of the flat `text`/`text_x`/... fields
(YAML-only, not practical from the Developer Tools UI form). If given, `texts` takes priority
over the flat fields:

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_layout
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  texts:
    - text: "Living room"
      x: 0
      y: 0
      size: 6
    - text: "21°C"
      x: 0
      y: 8
      size: 8
      color_hex: "ffcc00"
      scroll: true   # see below - this one scrolls, the one above stays static
```

Each item accepts: `text` (required), `x`, `y`, `size`, `font`, `color_hex`, `wrap`, `align`,
`scroll`, `line_spacing`, `blink`, `blink_interval_ms` - same meaning as the single-text fields
above (and below), just per item.

**Alignment:** `align` (or `text_align` for the single-text form) changes what `x`/`y` anchor:
`left` (default) anchors the text's left edge at `x` (unchanged from before); `right` anchors
its right edge at `x` (the text extends leftward from there); `center` anchors its horizontal
center at `x`. With multiple `\n`-separated lines of different widths, each line is also
aligned within the block itself the same way. Only static (non-scrolling) text is anchored
this way - scrolling text always anchors its left edge at `x` and moves rightward through the
available space, since a moving block has no fixed edge to anchor mid-scroll.

```yaml
# Right-align a value so it always ends flush at x=32, regardless of length
texts:
  - text: "12345"
    x: 32
    y: 4
    align: "right"
    wrap: false
```

**Preserving exact spacing:** word-wrap (`wrap`/`text_wrap: true`) reflows text and does not
preserve exact spacing between words. If you need leading/trailing/internal spaces exactly as
given (e.g. for manual alignment via spaces in the text itself), set `wrap: false` -
`send_layout` measures text by its font advance width, so spaces contribute to the layout
instead of being invisibly trimmed.

**Blinking:** set `blink: true` (plus optional `blink_interval_ms`, default 500) on any icon or
text item to make it blink on/off continuously - independent of, and combinable with,
scrolling text. Multiple blinking and/or scrolling elements are kept in sync with each other
(same least-common-multiple mechanism as multi-text scrolling, below).

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_layout
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  icons:
    - icon: "mdi:water-alert"
      x: 0
      y: 0
      size: 16
      blink: true
      blink_interval_ms: 300
  texts:
    - text: "ALARM"
      x: 16
      y: 4
      size: 8
      blink: true
      blink_interval_ms: 300
```

**Multiple icons** (up to 4) - use `icons` instead of the flat `icon`/`icon_x`/... fields
(YAML-only). If given, `icons` takes priority over the flat fields. Icons are always static
(no scrolling):

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_layout
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  icons:
    - icon: "mdi:weather-sunny"
      x: 0
      y: 0
      size: 16
      color_hex: "ffcc00"
    - icon: "mdi:water-percent"
      x: 16
      y: 0
      size: 16
      color_hex: "3399ff"
```

Each item accepts: `icon` (required), `x`, `y`, `size`, `color_hex`, `blink`, `blink_interval_ms`.
Icons never scroll, but can blink (see below).

Forcing a line break regardless of `wrap`/`text_wrap`: use `\n` in any text (works whether
typed literally into a GUI text field or as a real newline from YAML), e.g.
`text: "Living room\n21°C"`.

**Scrolling text:** set `wrap: false` (or `text_wrap: false` for the single-text form) and
`scroll: true` (or `text_scroll: true`) to make text too wide for the available space scroll
continuously (looping marquee GIF) instead of being clipped. No effect if the text already
fits - it's sent as a plain static image in that case. If more than one text in `texts`
scrolls, they're kept in sync with each other (their loops realign together, computed via the
least common multiple of their individual cycle lengths, capped to avoid runaway frame
counts on awkward combinations).

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_layout
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  text: "This message is too long to fit and will scroll"
  text_x: 0
  text_wrap: false
  text_scroll: true
  scroll_step: 2        # pixels moved per animation frame, shared by every scrolling text
  scroll_frame_ms: 80    # duration of each frame, in ms
  scroll_gap: 16         # blank pixels between the end of one pass and the next
```

> **Native vs. composed scrolling:** `ble_led_pixel.send_text` (below) scrolls text natively
> on the device - lighter and faster, but it always takes over the *entire* panel as a single
> string; it cannot be combined with an icon, an image, or other text, because the device
> protocol has no concept of a sub-region. Scrolling text *within* a `send_layout` composition
> is only achievable by generating the animation frames ourselves (as above), which is
> inherently heavier to transfer - expect it to take longer to load than a native
> `send_text` call, though it plays back smoothly once loaded.
>
> GIF sending (used by scrolling text, and by `send_image_file` below) is a newer code path
> than static images - if you hit `cur12k_no_answer: no ack from device` in the logs, or the
> panel just takes a long time to update, the device needs more time/data than for a static
> image. In practice, `scroll_step` is the one lever that reliably helps: doubling it roughly
> halves both the frame count and the transferred bytes (measured: a single long scrolling
> word at `scroll_step: 2` produced a 69-frame/13KB GIF; at `scroll_step: 4`, ~35 frames/6.4KB)
> - at the cost of a choppier motion. `send_layout` already merges identical consecutive
> frames and uses a small quantized color palette to keep GIFs as small as it can, but for a
> single long word filling most of the available width, there typically aren't any identical
> frames to merge, so `scroll_step` remains the main thing to adjust if a scroll is too slow
> to load. The BLE ACK timeout for image/GIF sends is already set higher (25s) than
> pypixelcolor's small-command default (8s) to give the device room to process bigger GIFs.

### `ble_led_pixel.send_image_file`

Sends an existing image or GIF file, read from disk, as-is. Supports PNG, GIF (including
animated GIFs, sent frame-by-frame with their own durations), JPEG, BMP, TIFF, WEBP, and
HEIC/HEIF. The file must be in a location Home Assistant can read, such as `/config/www/`.

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_image_file
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
data:
  file_path: "/config/www/my_animation.gif"
  resize_method: "crop"   # "crop" fills the panel and crops excess, "fit" pads with black
  save_slot: 0
```

### `ble_led_pixel.send_test_pattern`

Diagnostic only: sends a 4-quadrant colored pattern (red/green/blue/yellow) sized to the
panel, useful for verifying how the device's reported width/height maps onto the physical
panel when the two don't obviously match.

```yaml
action: ble_led_pixel.send_test_pattern
target:
  entity_id: text.living_room_display
```

## Font Management

- Place `.ttf`/`.otf` files in `fonts/` folder
- Restart HA to see new fonts in dropdown
- Recommended: pixel fonts like 5x5.ttf, 7x7.ttf
- The same bundled fonts (`3x5-de`, `5x5`, `7x5`, `Lepidos`, `OpenSans-Light`, `WP7xn`) are
  also available to `send_layout`'s `text_font` field
- `Lepidos` is a 3x7 pixel font (CC0/public domain, by SurrealEmber -
  https://surrealember.itch.io/lepidos), designed to be rendered at multiples of 16px
  (`text_size: 16`, `32`, ...) for crisp, correctly-proportioned glyphs
- Text rendering in `send_layout` thresholds to pure black/white (no anti-aliasing), so pixel
  fonts stay crisp regardless of size

## Troubleshooting

- Enable debug logging: `custom_components.ble_led_pixel: debug`
- Check auto-update is ON or use manual update button
- Verify templates in Developer Tools → Template
- Ensure device is in Bluetooth range
- For `send_mdi_icon`/`send_layout` failures, check that the device could reach
  `cdn.jsdelivr.net` (icons are fetched on demand, not bundled)
- For `send_layout` (scrolling text) or `send_image_file` failures with
  `cur12k_no_answer: no ack from device` in the logs, the GIF is likely too large/complex for
  the device to process in time - try a shorter message, fewer scroll frames
  (`text_scroll_step` higher), or a smaller source GIF file
